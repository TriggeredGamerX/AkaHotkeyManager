**Adds two hotkeys:**\
An elytra/chestplate swapping keybind. It prioritises items with a larger durability and then with a larger amount of enchant levels. Will also prioritise chestplates/elytra that are in your offhand. Default keybind 'G'.

A quick totem equipping keybind. Will equip a totem of undying into your offhand when pressed. Default keybind 'X'.
