## Admin Note

Hey Admins,

Exciting news! We've introduced a new mod for players that simplifies totem switching. It's important to note that it's not an auto totem mod. Instead, players set a hotkey, press it, and smoothly switch between totems. It's a user-friendly enhancement without the automation. Feel free to share the news with the community.

Cheers,
